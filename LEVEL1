Differentiate between SIMD and MIMD? Explain. 








 Illustrate and explain what a Von Neuman Architecture is.
 
 
 Von Neumann architecture is the design upon which many general purpose computers are based. 
 The key elements of von Neumann architecture aredata and instructions are both stored as binary digits
 data and instructions are both stored in primary storage
 instructions are fetched from memory one at a time and in order (serially)
 the processor decodes and executes an instruction, before cycling around to fetch the next instruction
 the cycle continues until no more instructions are available
