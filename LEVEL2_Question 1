How does parallel programming/computing works? What do you think
will be the advantage of utilizing parallel approach?


      In the simplest sense, parallel computing is the simultaneous use of multiple compute resources to solve a computational problem
a problem is broken into discrete parts that can be solved concurrently, each part is further broken down to a series of instructions
the advantage of utilizing parallel approach is save time and money throwing more resources at a task will shorten its time to completion,
with potential cost savings. parallel computers can be built from cheap, commodity components, solve larger more complex problemmany 
problems are so large or complex that it is impractical orimpossible to solve them on a single computer, especially given limited computer
memory.
